# Approach
 - I started reading the API and how it worked trying to understand how to use it.
 - Since there was a lot of data involved, I decided to use the API to get the data and then store it to be used by the app.
 - I satrted using a simple `HttpClient`with `Faraday`. I decided to use this because I used it before and it's very reliable and easy to use.
 - I created a mutli-threaded scraper(`CardFetcher`) to get the data from the API and store it in a database. This class also has an array working as kind of DLQ to store the pages that for some reason failed to be fetched.
 - Since the data was huge and made of different fields I decided not to manage it in memory. Instead I'm using a database which would not need any extra installation. I choose `SQLite3` becasue of the aforementioned reasons. Since I knew the scope of the problem and the structure of the data and also the capabilities of the database, I choose to manage all the data in a one simplified table(model).
 - For handling the data I used `Sequel` because I wanted to keep a simple queryable structure(not manage other tables consistency for now). Also it includes a pagination capability.
 - I'm using a custom filter(`Filter`) to manage the queries for the model(manage `Ã¬n` and `like` queries). And extending this logic in the `Card` model.
 - Finally I handle the command line execution using `OptionParser` so it can be called directly as a command line tool.
